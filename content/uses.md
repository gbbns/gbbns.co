Sometimes I get asked what 'what make is that', 'where did you get that from' or just what tools etc. I use day to day, and after reading the [page of at Wes Bos' site](http://wesbos.com/uses) I thought I'd shamelessly copy the format :)

## Editor + Terminal
Currently using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), yes I have tried [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/) et al. but I keep finding myself heading back to VS Code. I love the speed of it, I love the extensions, but overall after 8+ years of using the [grown up Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) it feels very familiar.

Until recently (the last 3 or so years) I've never really done things via the command line, however I now use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [Oh My ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/)

## Desktop Apps

* Sketch & Zeplin
* Spotify
* SourceTree (I told you I'm a n00b to the command line)
* Evernote/OneNote (One for work, one for personal)
* Photoshop
* Lightroom
* Chrome
* TweetDeck (OK, I know it's not strictly a desktop app...)
* DropBox

## Desk Setup
I'm yet to find a desk I truly love -- either to buy or to build -- so in the meantime I have the [IKEA Malm desk with pull out panel](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/desks/desk-computer-desks/malm-desk-with-pull-out-panel-oak-veneer-art-00214181/)

I sit on an [IKEA MARKUS](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/office-chairs/markus-swivel-chair-glose-black-art-20103101/) which I was lucky enough to get free in an office clearance.

The other chair in my office is the iconic [IKEA POÃ„NG](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/sofas-armchairs/armchairs/po%C3%A4ng-armchair-birch-veneer-finnsta-grey-spr-59090452/) this is my 'go-to' for relaxing/reading/playing video games.

## Other gear

### Tech
Due to the fact that I have a 4hr commute (~2hrs each way) I like to keep a charge on me all the time, enter the [Anker PowerCore 20100](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerCore-20100-Capacity-Technology-Black/dp/B00VJSGT2A) it suits my requirements to the ground, gives me numerous charges for my various devices and weighs pretty much nothing.

Keeping on the commute subject, I try to dip into reading when I can-or when I get motivated- so the obvious choice, aside from physical books, was to get an [Amazon Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-6-Inch-4GB-E-Reader/dp/B00QJDO0QC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1505463193&sr=1-1&keywords=kindle+paperwhite)

### Stationery
Currently rocking the [Nock Brasstown](http://nockco.com/cases/brasstown) pencil case. It's amazing. It wasn't cheap -- as I had to get it imported, then had to pay import duty on it :( -- but it's totally worth it, and always gets noticed.

I love to write in the superb [Leuchtturm 1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/notebooks/) notepads. I used to use [Moleskines](http://www.moleskine.com/gb/), but the Leuchtturm has fainter lines on the paper, which I like.

I write with either [Pilot G-tec C4](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilot-Microtip-Rollerball-Black-Pack/dp/B008LUQX9S) or the [Muji gel ink pens](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&Sub=52) though my ultimate goal is a [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanc.com/en-gb/home.html)

### Bags

* [Home of Millican](https://www.homeofmillican.com/) :
 * [Smith the roll pack - 25l](https://www.homeofmillican.com/collections/maverick-collection/products/the-mavericks-smith-the-roll-pack-25l-slate#product)
 * [Rob the traveller](https://vimeo.com/47250849)
 * [Christopher X Fuji](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Camera-Photo/Fujifilm-Millican-Christopher-Antique-Bronze-large-insert/B00NHOKON4)

I also have the [Thule Blur2](https://www.thule.com/en-gb/gb/backpacks/laptop-backpacks/thule-enroute-blur-2-_-3203402) but I'm not entirely satisfied with it. It replaced my old The North Face but has never felt as good as it.

### Photography
This year (2017) I traded in my [Canon 40D](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_40D) for a [pre-owned Fuji X-T1](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/)

Current lenses:

* [18mm f2](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18mmf2_r/)
* [35mm f2](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf2_r_wr/)
* [18-55mm f2.8-4](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/)

My pictures can currently be seen over at:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_gbbns/)
* [500px](https://500px.com/gbbns)
* itakepictur.es (coming soon)

### Other
I'm pretty agnostic when it comes to devices. Over the years I've had all the main players, my current phone is the [One+3T](https://oneplus.net/uk/3t)
