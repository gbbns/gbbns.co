I think it's been happening for a while, the slow realisation that age is creeping up on me.

Everytime I go for a haircut it appears there are more grey's than previous.

Then, suddenly I found myself googling ["when does a mid-life crisis start"](http://...)
[Content to flesh out why I feel 'old']

[What has this lead me to]

[Family 'manifesto' has fed into this]

[What is the family 'manifesto'?]

## Bucket list
At a guess, I'd say that everyone has some kind of list in their heads -- whether they'd admit it remains to be seen -- of things they'd like to see/do/experience before *_it_* happens.

I'm no different, for instance those close to me know that it's a life long ambition to live & work in Australia, I'd also love to go travelling [define travelling in context of this and my age.]

[list of current '40']

[the before is a play on the 40 things before you die, 40 things before 40 etc. I kept it vague in that respect. I also don't want the list to stop at 40, for me that is where it _starts_]
