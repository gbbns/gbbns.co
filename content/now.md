<h1>What Iâ€™m doing now</h1>

Life is hectic. To help distill things, these are what I am currently focussing my efforts on:

* On going work to improve my photography [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gbbns.co/).
* Devoting time out to meetup regularly with my mentor(s) for a coffee
* Trying (and failing) to take part in [GoodRead](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/4380722)'s reading challenge.
* Making a better effort to attend more local industry events &amp; meetups such as [NUX](http://nuxuk.org/), [UX&D](http://www.meetup.com/McrUXD/), as well as the great events being run within [Auto Trader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/)
* Keeping my dream of going to Australia alive.
