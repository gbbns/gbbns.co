# What Iâ€™m doing now

Life is a hectic affair; To help keep me sane and to give me some guidance, these are my current areas of focus:

## Photography
Improving my photography [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gbbns.co/) with my [new(ish) toy](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/)

## Work
* Devoting time out to meetup regularly with my mentor(s) for a coffee
* Making a better effort to attend more local industry events &amp; meetups such as [NUX](http://nuxuk.org/), [UX&D](http://www.meetup.com/McrUXD/), as well as the great events being run within [Auto Trader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/)

## Reading
Trying (and failing) to take part in [GoodRead](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/4380722)'s reading challenge.

## This site
Tweaking, improving, and growing my new online home.

## Hopes, dreams and ambitions
Keeping my dream of going to Australia alive.
