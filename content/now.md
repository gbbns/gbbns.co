# What Iâ€™m doing now

Life is hectic. To help distill things, these are what I am currently focussing my efforts on:

* Improving my photography [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gbbns.co/) with my [new(ish) toy](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/)
* Devoting time out to meetup regularly with my mentor(s) for a coffee
* Trying (and failing) to take part in [GoodRead](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/4380722)'s reading challenge.
* Making a better effort to attend more local industry events &amp; meetups such as [NUX](http://nuxuk.org/), [UX&D](http://www.meetup.com/McrUXD/), as well as the great events being run within [Auto Trader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/)
* Keeping my dream of going to Australia alive.
