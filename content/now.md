# What Iâ€™m doing now

Life is a hectic affair; To help keep me sane and to give me some guidance, these are my current areas of focus:

## Photography
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_gbbns" rel="noopener">Improving my photography</a>, [with my new(ish) toy](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/)

## Work
* Starting an &ldquo;Inclusive Design Guild&rdquo; with an awesome colleague
* Devoting time out to meetup regularly with my mentor(s) for a coffee
* Making a better effort to attend more local industry events &amp; meetups such as <a href="https://nuxuk.org/" rel="noopener">NUX</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/McrUXD/" rel="noopener">UX&amp;D</a> as well as the great events being run within <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.uk/" rel="noopener">Auto Trader</a>

## Reading
