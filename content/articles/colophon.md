This site ~~is built using [Atom](http://atom.io), generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).~~ is built using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), now generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbbns/gbbns.co) and published on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), phew.

Currently all pages are stripped right back to the bare bones -- and if they aren't they will be soon -- to enable me to get to grips with Hugo.

[I plan on plugging in Sass, a task runner of some kind, some PostCSS goodness and at some point, a design](https://github.com/gbbns/gbbns.co/issues).

I will keep this page updated as I make more changes to the site.
