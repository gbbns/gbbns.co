## Get in touch
Whether you have a question you'd like to ask, a request for me to speak at your event or you want me to help with FE or consult on your project then feel free to get in touch.

I normally respond the quickest on Twitter, so I'd recommend hitting my up on there for quick questions or to chat (DM's are open).

If you want to discuss a project, me working with you, speaking, or something longer, then please email me - though donâ€™t be offended if it takes a day or so to reply!
