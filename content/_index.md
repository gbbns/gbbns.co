# Hello hello.

## I'm [Chris Gibbons](/about), an experienced frontend developer based in Lancashire, UK.

I build fast, user friendly and accessible websites for the automotive industry, with a particular passion/obsession for well written &amp; clean code.

I've got over a decades experience as a front end developer and have recently found a passion for UX and accessibility. My career has been spent working for some of the top businesses---both agency and in-house---in Manchester. During this time I have been fortunate to have the chance to work on large scale, content-managed platforms for some of the largest companies in the UK.

I also [like to write](/writing) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_gbbns" rel="noopener">take pictures</a>, amongst other things.
