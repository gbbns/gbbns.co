# Hello hello.

I'm [Chris Gibbons](/about), an experienced frontend developer based in Lancashire, UK. I help build fast, user friendly and accessible websites for the automotive industry, with a particular passion/mild obsession for well written &amp; clean code.

I've got over a decades experience as a front end developer and have recently found a passion for UX and accessibility. My career has been spent working for some of the top businesses---both agency and in-house---in Manchester. During this time I have had been fortunate to have the chance to work on large scale, content-managed platforms for some of the largest companies in the UK.

I also like to [write](/writing) and [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/gbbns.co) amongst other things.
