      <description>A potted history Chris Gibbons is an experienced digital developer specialising in front-end development, with a mild obsession for well written &amp;amp; clean code.
He also hates speaking about himself in the third person.
After working with the amazing guys at Code Computerlove for nearly 8 years, working my way up to Snr. Front End developer, I then spent the next 12 months working as a UI engineer at Zuto where I enjoyed the challenge of trying to build a bridge between front-end and UX in the world of car finance.</description>
