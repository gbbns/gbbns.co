      <description>770.6 miles, that was what was on the car&amp;rsquo;s milometer when I pulled up on the driveway after a week away.
The family had been to Devon, we left the previous Friday to visit the “English Riviera”. My only previous encounter with the South Coast had been a visit to the New Forest before a week on the Isle of Wight. We loved that trip and it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say we enjoyed this.</description>
