			<p>When it&rsquo;s <strong>not</strong> there, life is tough, <strong>everything</strong> is a struggle, things you once enjoyed start to become a chore. Sound familiar to anyone?</p>

<p>Several years ago, I hit this very problem, and it&rsquo;s taken until now for me to properly speak up about it.</p>

<p>So, why now? Simple really, I&rsquo;m now at the total opposite stage.</p>

<p>2013 was a pretty crappy year, and to be honest so was most of 2014 &ndash; for a number of different reasons &ndash; and to top if off I really hit an all time low with &lsquo;the internet&rsquo;, to the point where I was ready to completely jack it all in and change career.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when exactly, or what, triggered this. Looking back it was probably a number of things which all came together to hit me hard.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;eureka&rsquo; moment came when I attended <a href="https://www.dddnorth.co.uk/">DDD North</a> one of the sessions <a href="https://www.dddnorth.co.uk/Sessions/Details/125">Burnout Is Real And It&rsquo;s Coming To Get You</a> struck a chord and really resonated with some of the issues I&rsquo;d been facing.</p>

<p>I remember being sat next to a few developers on the day, and to say they were highly cynical of this was an understatement. It&rsquo;s easy to judge when you&rsquo;re not in that situation, the lack of empathy shown from these seasoned developers was shocking.</p>

<p>On the train back home I started to think about what <a href="https://twitter.com/richardadalton">Richard</a> talked about. For the first time in what seemed like an age, I got my notepad out and started to write things down. I realise now that this was the start of the long road out of the dip I was in.</p>

<p>Fast forward 12 months, I&rsquo;d just had a 121 with my team leads. It didn&rsquo;t go well and this shocked me, deeply.</p>

<p>I felt like a failure, but I didn&rsquo;t let it get me down &ndash; well, not too much &ndash; instead, afterwards I got my notepad out and again started to make notes.</p>

<p>I analysed what was said, whether I felt it fair or not &ndash; and let&rsquo;s just be clear, not <em><strong>all</strong></em> of what was said was either fair or totally justified &ndash; I looked at reasons why these things may have been said, I looked at what I could do to stop things, to improve things.</p>

<p>These quiet musings, led me to one <strong>very</strong> clear epiphany &ndash; it was time for me to move jobs &ndash; this move turned out to be far more important that I could <em>ever</em> imagine.</p>

<p>I now blog more than I&rsquo;ve ever done, I have more thoughts/opinions on things than I have done for a long long time. I find myself scribbling notes on side projects all the time, I have ideas on things &ndash; not just work related &ndash; a lot more.</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think this is sudden influx in motivation is <em>entirely</em> down to a move in jobs, but it&rsquo;s certainly helped.</p>

<p>I attend <a href="https://www.meetup.com/McrFRED/">more</a> <a href="https://nuxuk.org/">community</a> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/McrUXD/">meetups</a> now, all which not only help get me thinking, but get me involved and talking to likeminded people in the Manchester web community. At Christmas I bought a Kindle. Rather than sleeping or wasting my commute to work, I&rsquo;m making a conscious effort to read more, to get engrossed in a book, to let my imagination run wild.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also realised that I needed to have some outlets away from the internet, enter DIY and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_gbbns">photography</a>. I&rsquo;m by no means great at either, but having that time away from the keyboard, away from the distractions of <a href="https://twitter.com/_gbbns">Twitter</a>, allows me some amazing time to think about things, to process thoughts which I&rsquo;d forgotten about.</p>

<p>Put all this together, and as you can probably guess, it&rsquo;s really starting to have a positive impact on things.</p>

<p>The future is looking <strong>good</strong>.</p>
