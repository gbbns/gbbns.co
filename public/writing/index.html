                    <h2>Moving To Hugo</h2>
                    <p>15th August 2017</p>
                    <p>If I was to look at the internet archive wayback machine I could hand on heart say I&rsquo;ve never had a personal website I&rsquo;ve ever really been happy with.
I&rsquo;m not a designer, and I&rsquo;m fine with that. Aside from that I&rsquo;ve never really found a platform that I gel with. I had static html and I liked it, but with all developers I didn&rsquo;t like the manual process of FTP&rsquo;ing to a server, along with maintaining links, URL&rsquo;s etc.</p>

                    <h2>You</h2>
                    <p>4th October 2016</p>
                    <p>770.6 miles, that was what was on the car&rsquo;s milometer when I pulled up on the driveway after a week away.
The family had been to Devon, we left the previous Friday to visit the “English Riviera”. My only previous encounter with the South Coast had been a visit to the New Forest before a week on the Isle of Wight. We loved that trip and it&rsquo;s safe to say we enjoyed this.</p>

                    <h2>Broken</h2>
                    <p>25th August 2016</p>
                    <p>I can&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly when, but I&rsquo;ve come to the realisation that the daily routine I&rsquo;ve worked so hard to build is broken.
After a coffee &amp; chinwag with my good friend Dan Furze, it seems that it&rsquo;s not just me, which is always reassuring.
I&rsquo;m aware that everyone has natural peaks and troughs in life - hell I&rsquo;ve had enough myself - but recently it&rsquo;s felt like I&rsquo;ve been unable to climb out of this one.</p>

                    <p>12th July 2016</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;A rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success&rdquo; - Bo Bennett.
I&rsquo;m not going to go into the full details, but twice in the space of 4 weeks I&rsquo;ve been left having to deal with some kind of rejection.
Now this isn&rsquo;t a post wanting pity, it&rsquo;s more to serve as a permanent reminder to me, personally, on how I&rsquo;ve dealt with it, and also something which may help others.</p>

                    <h2>Burning the candle</h2>
                    <p>6th April 2016</p>
                    <p>The great thing about Marc&rsquo;s&lsquo;30 day writing challenge&rsquo; is reading such a great cross section of varied content, as well as gaining a lot of inspiration.
One of the themes I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the most so far has been around people&rsquo;s morning &amp; evening routines.
Some people get up early and write, others check emails, whilst some use their &ldquo;spare time&rdquo; to exercise &mdash; the reason for the quotes is that this is very much dependent on peoples individual set of circumstances, I know in my life at present the very concept of spare time is but a dream and it irks me when people comment or question other peoples dedication to things without knowing the set of circumstances surrounding the person(s).</p>
