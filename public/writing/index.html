                    <p>11th January 2018</p>
                    <p>Christmas is officially over; The decorations are now down and all safely tucked away in the attic until the mega marketing machine rolls around next time.
I&rsquo;m a little late with this review and no doubt by now many people have written down long lists of unachievable things they want to stop, or start, doing this year. As for me I stopped doing resolutions a few years back mainly as I just didn&rsquo;t stick to them - they&rsquo;re usually out of the window before January has finished, instead I like to set goals for the year, mainly as I feel they&rsquo;re not only more achieveable but also easier to manage and work towards over the course of 12 months.</p>

                    <h2>2018 Preview</h2>
                    <p>11th January 2018</p>
                    <p>My initial thought, on the face of it, is that 2018 promises a lot.
I&rsquo;m working hard on getting that &lsquo;principal&rsquo; moniker in my title; It&rsquo;s something to strive for, even though I&rsquo;m not looking for something to hang my hat off. Coupled with that is looking at running some form of external workshop - accessibility related - and hopefully speaking at a conference and/or meet up(s)
Goals for 2018  Principal FE promotion Take at least one holiday, either in the UK or abroad Write more: Aim to publish at least 6 main blog posts in the year, as well as 12 shorter posts in the &lsquo;latest notes&rsquo; section Speak at at least one of the following: a local (Manchester) meetup, speak at a (UK) meetup, or speak at a conference Keep my website up to date Start my bucket list website  And with that thank you, 2017, you&rsquo;ve been a blast, here&rsquo;s to 2018.</p>

                    <p>15th August 2017</p>
                    <p>If I was to look at the internet archive wayback machine I could hand on heart say I&rsquo;ve never had a personal website I&rsquo;ve ever really been happy with.
I&rsquo;m not a designer, and I&rsquo;m fine with that. Aside from that I&rsquo;ve never really found a platform that I gel with. I had static html and I liked it, but with all developers I didn&rsquo;t like the manual process of FTP&rsquo;ing to a server, along with maintaining links, URL&rsquo;s etc.</p>

                    <p>770.6 miles, that was what was on the car&rsquo;s milometer when I pulled up on the driveway after a week away.
The family had been to Devon, we left the previous Friday to visit the “English Riviera”. My only previous encounter with the South Coast had been a visit to the New Forest before a week on the Isle of Wight. We loved that trip and it&rsquo;s safe to say we enjoyed this.</p>
