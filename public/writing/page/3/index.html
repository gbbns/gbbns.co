                    <h2>A belated preview</h2>
                    <p>6th March 2016</p>
                    <p>This blog post is by no means going to cover the entire year, in-fact it may be irrelevant before it even gets published, all I will say is that this year is shaping up to be a good one, I can feel it.
Towards the end of last year I had a period of reflection. I looked back at what I had achieved during the year, as well as having an eye on what I wished to develop in the coming year &mdash; both personally and professionally.</p>

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>19th February 2016</p>
                    <p>When it&rsquo;s not there, life is tough, everything is a struggle, things you once enjoyed start to become a chore. Sound familiar to anyone?
Several years ago, I hit this very problem, and it&rsquo;s taken until now for me to properly speak up about it.
So, why now? Simple really, I&rsquo;m now at the total opposite stage.
2013 was a pretty crappy year, and to be honest so was most of 2014 &ndash; for a number of different reasons &ndash; and to top if off I really hit an all time low with &lsquo;the internet&rsquo;, to the point where I was ready to completely jack it all in and change career.</p>

                <a href="/writing/workflow-happiness/">
                    <h2>Workflow happiness</h2>
                    <p>15th February 2016</p>
                    <p>Over the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve had similar conversations with a few colleague &amp; friends with regards website CMS&rsquo; systems and workflows, which in turn lead me to reflect on my current setup.
After looking at various CMS platforms, recently and over the past few years, the choice is staggering. Ranging from simple to the ridiculous, it is scary how many of these platforms can confuse and overwhelm the users, to the point where they actually fear using it.</p>

                <a href="/writing/what-a-year/">
                    <h2>What a year</h2>
                    <p>4th February 2016</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s now February 2016, almost a year to the day that Samuel was born, and things are only just beginning to slow down enough to actually gather my thoughts from the last 12 months.
I always knew that 2015 was going to be a stand-out year due to the fact that fatherhood was impending&hellip; But I had no idea just how much of a year it would actually be.
January brought about a mandatory period of abstinence from alcohol, partly due to the yearly Christmas excess, but mainly due to being &lsquo;on-call&rsquo; for a trip to the hospital.</p>

                <a href="/writing/welcome/">
                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>2nd February 2016</p>
                    <p>So, after countless promises over the past few years, here we are!
I&rsquo;ve finally got round to sorting out my new site, it&rsquo;s now running on Jekyll and is an absolute breeze to keep up to date.
Hopefully as time progresses I&rsquo;ll get round to adding a little more colour, as well as more blog posts - as I have plenty planned&hellip;
