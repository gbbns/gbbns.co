                    <h2>The now page</h2>
                    <p>1st April 2016</p>
                    <p>I like the idea of a now page. It&rsquo;s got a point. It&rsquo;s not on the site to bullshit, it&rsquo;s there to tell people what you, or I, are doing now.
From time to time I get asked what am I doing, what am I working on and if it&rsquo;s anything good, do I have any side projects on the go, how&rsquo;s my photography coming on, etc&hellip;
I first came across the now page on Marc&rsquo;s site and was instantly hooked on it, and as he&rsquo;d handily included links to other sites where he himself had got inspiration.</p>

                    <h2>The 30 day writing challenge</h2>
                    <p>1st April 2016</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve known for a while that writing was going to be important to me this year, but as with all best laid plans&hellip;
I started of on a really good footing, I quite quickly managed to rattle of more posts in a single month than I&rsquo;d managed in the 5+ previous years of trying. Then things slowed down. Life kind of took over. Whilst not exactly losing interest in blogging, or writing &ndash; as I&rsquo;ve managed to make quite a healthy list of things I wish to write about &ndash; more I lost the initial discipline that I&rsquo;d been under.</p>

                    <h2>A belated preview</h2>
                    <p>6th March 2016</p>
                    <p>This blog post is by no means going to cover the entire year, in-fact it may be irrelevant before it even gets published, all I will say is that this year is shaping up to be a good one, I can feel it.
Towards the end of last year I had a period of reflection. I looked back at what I had achieved during the year, as well as having an eye on what I wished to develop in the coming year &mdash; both personally and professionally.</p>

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>19th February 2016</p>
                    <p>When it&rsquo;s not there, life is tough, everything is a struggle, things you once enjoyed start to become a chore. Sound familiar to anyone?
Several years ago, I hit this very problem, and it&rsquo;s taken until now for me to properly speak up about it.
So, why now? Simple really, I&rsquo;m now at the total opposite stage.
2013 was a pretty crappy year, and to be honest so was most of 2014 &ndash; for a number of different reasons &ndash; and to top if off I really hit an all time low with &lsquo;the internet&rsquo;, to the point where I was ready to completely jack it all in and change career.</p>

                    <h2>Workflow happiness</h2>
                    <p>15th February 2016</p>
                    <p>Over the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve had similar conversations with a few colleague &amp; friends with regards website CMS&rsquo; systems and workflows, which in turn lead me to reflect on my current setup.
After looking at various CMS platforms, recently and over the past few years, the choice is staggering. Ranging from simple to the ridiculous, it is scary how many of these platforms can confuse and overwhelm the users, to the point where they actually fear using it.</p>
