      <description>If I was to look at the internet archive wayback machine I could hand on heart say I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a personal website I&amp;rsquo;ve ever really been happy with.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a designer, and I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that. Aside from that I&amp;rsquo;ve never really found a platform that I gel with. I had static html and I liked it, but with all developers I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the manual process of FTP&amp;rsquo;ing to a server, along with maintaining links, URL&amp;rsquo;s etc.</description>
