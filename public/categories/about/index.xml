      <description>A potted history Chris Gibbons is an experienced digital developer specialising in traditional front-end development practises, UI/UX and mobile.
He has a passion/mild obsession for well written, semantic &amp;amp; accessible code. He enjoys the challenge of learning and using new and emerging technologies to better projects, as well as delivering cross-device, compliant, usable websites.
He also hates speaking about himself in the third person, so lets stop.
After working with the amazing folk at Code Computerlove for nearly 8 years, working my way up to Snr.</description>
